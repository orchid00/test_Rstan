# the number of parameters in a model gives a mesuarement of 
# complexity
# if some parameters are correlated then it means, there are
# less number of efficient parameters

# LPPD = log posterior density LPPD
# P = parameters
# waic = -2 (LPPD - P)

# MCMC
# Marcov Models
# samples are correlated between consecutive points.
# that's why we take every 10th or every 100th 
# 10 thousand 10^4 points is common to select
# we burn the first 1000 
# if we have 3 chains of values, then you realize the
# tend to converge
# tipycally at least 3 chains
# Rhat measures how similar the chains are 
# (if it is similar to 1 they are convereged )
